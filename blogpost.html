                    <p><u>Grand Canyon's Flaming Gorge</u> got its name for its
                        blazing red and orange colored, twelve-hundred-foot-high walls.
                        Grand Canyon's Disaster Falls was named to commemorate the site
                        of a previous explorer's wreck. Grand Canyon's Marble Canyon got its
                        name from its thousand-foot-thick seam of marble and for its walls
                        eroded to a polished glass finish.

                        in 1988 discovered in 1984 by Gary Tenen and Randy Tufts.
                        The formation in the Caverns are called Speleothems. They
                        form when water passes from the surface into the cave. The
                        minerals in the cave mixed with the water over time form these
                        amazing and archetypal giant cave structures.

                    <p>The <u>Petrified Forest</u> is the only national park site that contains a segment of the
                        Historic Route 66 alignment. The brilliant colors in the petrified
                        wood come mainly from three minerals. Pure quartz is white, manganese
                        oxides form blue, purple, black, and brown, and iron oxides provide hues
                        from yellow through red to brown. Petrified wood is the state fossil.

                    <p>The <u>Colossal Cave</u> was formed during the Mississippian Period. When water
                        seeped through the rocks and dissolved away part of the limestone. It's the third
                        largest cave and one of the 5% of dry/dormant caves in the world. Which means
                        it's still alive, but no longer growing. It makes it one of the rare caves where pictures
                        can be taken inside. The cave stays an even 70 year round.
